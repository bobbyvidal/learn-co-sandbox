Hi! 👋

You've opened the IDE Sandbox. 🎉

The Sandbox is an environment that you can access on "readme" and "code-along" lessons in Learn. It's a great place to experiment with code when you're not working on a "lab" (labs open the IDE In Browser).

The work you do in the Sandbox will be saved from lesson to lesson, and is automatically saved on your behalf to a repository in your GitHub account called `learn-co-sandbox`.

Please DO NOT touch this repository in GitHub, as it will affect your Sandbox experience, and potentially cause your work to be out of sync.

To learn more about the Sandbox, please visit http://help.learn.co/ide-in-browser#sandbox.
function find(array, criteriaFn) {
  // initialize two variables, `current`, and `next`
  // `current` keeps track of the element that we're
  // currently on, just like we did when unpacking the
  // array above; `next` is itself an array that keeps
  // track of the elements (which might be arrays!) that
  // we haven't looked at yet
  let current = array
  let next = []
 
  // hey, a `while` loop! this loop will only
  // trigger if `current` is truthy — so when
  // we exhaust `next` and, below, attempt to
  // `shift()` `undefined` (when `next` is empty)
  // onto `current`, we'll exit the loop
  while (current) {
    // if `current` satisfies the `criteriaFn`, then
    // return it — recall that `return` will exit the
    // entire function!
    if (criteriaFn(current)) {
      return current
    }
 
    // if `current` is an array, we want to push all of
    // its elements (which might be arrays) onto `next`
    if (Array.isArray(current)) {
      for (let i = 0; i < current.length; i++) {
        next.push(current[i])
      }
    }
 
    // after pushing any children (if there
    // are any) of `current` onto `next`, we want to take
    // the first element of `next` and make it the
    // new `current` for the next pass of the `while`
    // loop
    current = next.shift()
  }
 
  // if we haven't
  return null
